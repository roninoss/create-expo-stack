Update Nativewind templates to follow v4 best practices: replace SafeAreaView with safe area utility classes, add SafeAreaProvider at app root, fix className concatenation bug, use interface + React.FC typing, and remove unused Container component from no-navigation projects. Re-enable react-navigation test coverage for stack, tabs, and drawer+tabs across all styling packages.
