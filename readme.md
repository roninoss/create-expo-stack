## Tech Stack for the templates

Currently, all of the [templates](https://github.com/danstepanov/create-expo-stack) use the same versions of the following libraries. Not all of the templates include all of the libraries, but they are all available for use.

The templates themselves are located in the branches of this repository. You can explore them by toggling the branch dropdown above. You are welcome to use these templates directly, but it is recommended to use the CLI tool instead.
